                                <h3>What is a Recruitment Software anyway?</h3>
                                <p>Recruitment Software - also often called as <em>applicant tracking system</em> (ATS) - is a tool that enables companies to electronically handle their recruitment needs. Recruitment softwares are used by both large enterprises and smaller companies, but vary in functionality and features depending on the needs of the company. A Recruitment software is very similar to customer relationship management (CRM) systems, but is designed specifically for recruitment tracking purposes.</p>

                                <h3>What does a Recruitment Software do?</h3>
                                <p>The primary job of a recruitment software is centralizing all the information about a company's recruitment efforts in a database. Applicant Tracking Systems are designed to add structure to the processing of resumes and applicant information. Applicant data is either collected from internal applications (through the front-end), located on the company website or is extracted from applicants on job boards. Some modern ATSs allow applicants to be sourced from the company's own database of past job applicants.</p>

                                <h3>What are the types of Recruitment Software?</h3>
                                <p>Almost all companies use some kind of applicant tracking system or recruitment software to handle job applications and to manage resume data. Some smaller firms use email and/or spreadsheets to manage this, but most companies use a dedicated ATS for recruitment specific needs. In large enterprises, recruitment software may be offered as one of the numerous modules of a complex human resources suite or <em>Human Resource Information System (HRIS)</em>.</p>
                                <p>The older recruitment softwares are typically installed within the company premises and have a one-time installation cost. In recent years, the ATS is expanding into small and medium enterprises through software as a service offerings (SaaS). With SaaS, companies can now pay for recruitment software on a pay-as-you-go basis. This has been instrumental in increasing the penetration of ATS in smaller companies.</p>
